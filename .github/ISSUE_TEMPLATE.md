## Think you found a bug?

Please do one of these things:

1.  Don't open an issue, open a pull request with a failing test.
2.  Boil down your issue on codesandbox. TODO: Insert template
3.  Don't be upset if your bug report is closed without comment. If you don't have the time to prove the bug is not a problem with your own code then we certainly don't either ðŸ˜….

## Have a question?

Questions are welcome. They'll usually be answered with a link to some docs.

## Feature Request?

We keep the API and feature set pretty limited on purpose so it's unlikely we'll want it implemented, but you're welcome to make a suggestion.
